Project Proposal
Information about me:
•	Full Name: Bimanov Chingis
•	ID: 220103212
•	Course: 2year Information Systems
•	Lecture Group: [18-N]
•	Practice Group: [37-P]


Language: Java (designed by using JavaFX).
Goal/Theme: to make a system that will help users to find suitable for them living quarters, using a global search on my mini site and sorting to filter houses by certain parameters (for example, by area or price).
Algorithms:  Binary Search, Bubble sort
EXTRA algorithm: Linear search
Explanation: In the github repository link I've thrown to you can observe all the necessary classes and .fxml files. There are three main pages in my project: registration page, authorization page and the main page with the main work of my code. In this regard, I have 3 controller classes and 3 .fxml files responsible for the work of the project.
Usage:   
Binary search is used to find one special house by name that user is needed in from list of houses.
Bubble sort is used to sort houses by price or area.
Linear search is used to find only available houses.
 
1)	HelloApplication class – main class, through that class I run the code.
2) HelloController class is connected with Hello-View.fxml, they show you the page where you can login into your account.
3) RegistrationController clas is connected with App.fxml, they denote registration page where you can create your account.
4) MainPage class is connected with mainPage.fxml, they show page after you logged into system, where you can search and sort houses by your purpose.
5) Methods class is used for repeated button presses when logging in, registering, authorizing, going back and logging out.
6) User class is used to save the registration data, and then use that data to log in to the system. It creates file with personal data into user package in resources.
(* class names are in bold).
Full explanation of this project will be provided while defense time, thank you!
